# Mack To Sample

- delayed match to sample task with varying, pseudo-randomised delays
- uses clipart from PTSBattery and BOSS stimuli (hundreds of images; thus, programme loads stimuli at beginning of a trial by sampling from file names in the stimuli folder)
- reads parameters for sprite sheet, delays, repetitions per delay (influences block length), ITI, timeout, inter-block interval, and total runtime
- writes session parameters and data sheet
- reasonably commented
